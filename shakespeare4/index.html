                <p>New blog adress: <a href="">http://liveandletlearn.net/learning/</a><p>
                <p>During the last holidays I've been busy moving my blog from 
                <a href="">absoludity.net</a> to <a href="">liveandletlearn.net</a> ... why? Good question! Part of the
                Web Design course that I facilitate is a client project where participants 
                are required to develop a site from start to finish - and it'd been a while
                since I'd been through that process myself - so what better a project  for 
                the holidays (next to my gardening project to get me away from the 
                computer)!<p>
                    
                
                <p>You'll notice that the site is still in prototype stage, but the blog is all
                up and running so I'm going to be using liveandletlearn from now on.
                <b>Please update your bookmarks/feeds</b>! And Please give me any 
                feedback you've got time for at <a href="">liveandletlearn.net</a></p>
