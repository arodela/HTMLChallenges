            <p>This is one of the most famus of the sonnets. It is refered in the film
            Dead Poets Society and gave names to the bans The Darling Buds and the book
            television series the Darling Buds of May. Read it and weep!</p>
            
            <h4>Shall I compare thee to a sumer's day?<h4>
            <h4>Thou art more lovely and more temperate:</h4>
            <h4>Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,</h4>
            <h4>And summer's lease hath all too short a date:</h4>
            <h4>Sometime too hot the eye of havens shines,</h4>
            <h4>And often is gold complexion dimm'd,</h4>
            <h4>And every fair from fair sometime declines,</h4>
            <h4>By chance, or nature's changing course untrimm'd</h4>
            <h4>But thy eternal summer shall not fade,</h4>
            <h4>Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow'st,</h4>
            <h4>Nor shall death brag thou wander'st in his shade,</h4>
            <h4>So long as man can breathe, or eyes can see,</h4>
            <h4>So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.</h4>
